You should probably soft link all the config files.

If you would like to use the font that I have, use `Meslo LG S for Powerline Bold`
If you are not using a powerline font then comment or delete line 134 `let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1`

If you are on windows and using PUTTY then see pdalinis.blogspot.com/2013/08/putty-powerline.html
