This is a list of various notes that I keep.
Why keep it on `git` and `GitHub`? 
Notes are just text and I can't imagine the size of these becoming dramatically
large, even if I start including some pictures.
At the time of writing my `.git` folder is 2000x larger (Notes is <1M), so this is super cheap.

The advantage is that I can read or add notes from any machine I work on,
because I'm almost certainly going to have my dotfiles with me.
I suggest you do the same.

# Notes
- [Bashing around](/Notes/bashing_around.md): Notes about bash/zsh commands and scripting.
- [ffmpeg](/Notes/ffmpeg.md): Can anyone remember ffmpeg?
- [linux](/Notes/linux.md): Notes about the linux operating system. Things like systemd, cuda drivers, and all that fun stuff
- [networking](/Notes/networking.md): Some stuff on network commands. Like how to debug, fail2ban, etc
- [OSX](/Notes/osx.md): Notes for mac
- [Python](/Notes/python.md): Mostly empty but maybe some things I forget about ipython configs, envs, or some command/trick I want to remember
- [Data Recovery](/Notes/data_recovery.md): I'll update this on those rare     occasions I have to do data recovery because I'm an idiot that `rm -rf`'d the wrong dir and my aliases didn't work or aren't used
