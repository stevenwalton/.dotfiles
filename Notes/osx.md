# Apps to Install

## Objective See Security Tools
Here are some good security related apps from [Objective
See](https://objective-see.org/). Many of these will help you detect if malware
is placed on your machine and they aren't very resource intensive.
These tools are free and Open Source. There's plenty here that are overkill for
most users.

- [LuLu](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html): Lets you know about unknown outgoing connections.
- [RandsomeWhere](https://objective-see.org/products/ransomwhere.html): Tells
you if files are being encrypted and interrupts. This can sometimes be annoying
