# NFTS Recovery
[scrounge-ntfs](https://github.com/lcorbasson/scrounge-ntfs) appears to work
well.
Recovered files on a large thumbdrive that was in storage and had been wiped
several times.
Drive was corrupted too!

Dear god, it is the 2000th and 24th year of our lord and Apple still does not
enable writing of NTFS formatted drives. Microsoft still pushes this and they
are prolific. This only results in Apple users exposing themselves to security
issues as any solution requires Arm users to boot into recovery and disable
security settings. Yes, this would be "user error" but it is a problem created
by Apple for not only not supporting NTFS, but making it even harder with the
advent of Arm machines. We're on the 3rd generation for Christ's sake! This is
worse than when Microsoft bought Skype and then downgraded Linux functionality!
