# Skeletons
This directory contains both skeletons and templates

Skeletons are files that are usable and can be built upon. 
Some of these can be placed in `/etc/skel/` to be automatically added upon new
user creations. 

Templates are annotated configurations with some useful options. Meant to be
highly edited and serve more as a reference.
